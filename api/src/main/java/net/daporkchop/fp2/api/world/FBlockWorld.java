/**
 * A read-only world consisting of voxels at integer coordinates, where each voxel contains the following information:<br>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A block state (represented as an {@code int}, as returned by the corresponding methods in {@link FGameRegistry})</li>
 *     <li>A biome (represented by an {@code int}, as returned by the corresponding methods in {@link FGameRegistry})</li>
 *     <li>A block light level and sky light level (represented as a {@code byte}, as returned by {@link #packLight(int, int)}). Light levels are unsigned nibbles (4-bit integers),
 *     where {@code 0} is the darkest and {@code 15} is the brightest possible value.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Implementations <strong>must</strong> be thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * All bulk operations write their output to arrays. 2-dimensional queries operate over a square area and write their output in {@code X,Z} coordinate order, while
 * 3-dimensional queries operate over a cubic volume and write their output in {@code X,Y,Z} coordinate order.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, bulk queries accept a {@code stride} parameter, which defines the spacing between sampled voxels. There are three distinct cases for this value:<br>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>All strides {@code <= 0} are invalid, and produce undefined behavior.</li>
 *     <li>A stride of exactly {@code 1} indicates that the voxels to be sampled are tightly packed. Implementations are required to return the exact information which would
 *     exist at the given position.</li>
 *     <li>All strides {@code > 1} indicate that voxels to be sampled have the given spacing between each voxel. Samples are taken every {@code stride} voxels, where each sample
 *     consists of a value which most accurately represents all of the voxels in the {@code stride²} area (for the 2-dimensional case) or {@code stride³} volume (for the 3-dimensional case).</li>
 * </ul>
